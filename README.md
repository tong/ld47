## HowTo
Goal is to whipe all other players from the map.  
You can navigate to all atoms you own and fire the electrons to the direction of other atoms.  
If you hit an atom you either own it if it is not owned by other players, or destroy electrons of other players. Electrons with the **+** sign are special electrons which spawn new electrons on the atom they are orbiting in intervals.
